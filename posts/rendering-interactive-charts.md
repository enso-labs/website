Building AI agents that can do more than just talk is the new frontier. At [Enso Labs](https://github.com/enso-labs/orchestra), we're building **DeepAgents**—composed AI workflows that interact with complex tools and data.

One common challenge developers face is displaying rich data, like interactive charts, within a chat interface. LLMs are great at text, but they can't natively generate a Plotly chart or a React component.

In this post, we'll explore how we solved this using **LangGraph**'s `content_and_artifact` feature and a custom React renderer.

## The Challenge: Text vs. Visuals

When an agent analyzes stock prices, it might retrieve a CSV of historical data.

- **The LLM** needs this data in text format (like CSV) to reason about it ("The price went up on Tuesday").
- **The User** wants to see a line chart, not a wall of numbers.

We need a way to send _two_ different representations of the same result: one for the AI, and one for the UI.

## The Solution: `content_and_artifact`

LangChain and LangGraph introduced a tool feature called `content_and_artifact` (see [LangChain Tools docs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/tools)). This allows a tool to return a tuple: `(content, artifact)`.

- `content`: The text representation for the model (e.g., CSV).
- `artifact`: Arbitrary data for the system/UI (e.g., a JSON object representing a Plotly chart).

## Installation

Before diving in, let’s install the required dependencies for both backend (Python) and frontend (React):

### Backend (Python) Dependencies

You'll need `yfinance`, `plotly`, and LangGraph/LangChain Core packages. If you use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```sh
uv pip install yfinance plotly langchain
```

_(You may need to add any other packages your project requires)_

### Frontend (React) Dependencies

For rendering Plotly charts in React, you’ll need:

```sh
npm install plotly.js-dist-min react-plotly.js
```

If you don’t have React/TypeScript set up, refer to your local setup or try [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## 1. The Backend: Python Tool

Here is our implementation of a stock price tool. We use `yfinance` to get data and `plotly.express` to generate the chart.

```python
import yfinance as yf
from langchain.tools import tool
import plotly.express as px

@tool(response_format="content_and_artifact")
def get_stock_price_history(ticker: str, period: str = "1mo") -> str:
    """Get the stock price history and return a Plotly chart."""

    # 1. Fetch data
    ticker_obj = yf.Ticker(ticker)
    hist = ticker_obj.history(period=period)
    hist = hist.reset_index()

    # 2. Create Plotly figure
    fig = px.line(
        hist,
        x="Date",
        y="Close",
        title=f"{ticker} Closing Price"
    )

    # 3. Return Tuple: (CSV for LLM, JSON for UI)
    return hist.to_csv(index=False), fig.to_json()
```

Notice the `response_format="content_and_artifact"` in the decorator. This tells LangGraph to handle the return value as a tuple.

---

## 2. The Frontend: React Renderer

On the frontend, we receive the tool execution result. When the artifact contains a Plotly JSON structure, we pass it to our `ChartRenderWidget`.

Here is the React component that renders the chart:

```tsx
import Plotly from "plotly.js-dist-min";
import createPlotlyComponent from "react-plotly.js/factory";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const Plot = createPlotlyComponent(Plotly);

const ChartRenderWidget = ({ content }: { content: any }) => {
  const [plotData, setPlotData] = useState<any[]>([]);
  const [layout, setLayout] = useState<any>({});

  useEffect(() => {
    try {
      // Parse the JSON artifact from the backend
      const parsedContent = JSON.parse(content);
      setPlotData(parsedContent?.data || []);
      setLayout(parsedContent?.layout || {});
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("Failed to parse chart data", e);
    }
  }, [content]);

  return (
    <div style={{ width: "100%", height: "400px" }}>
      <Plot
        data={plotData}
        layout={{ ...layout, autosize: true }}
        useResizeHandler={false}
        style={{ width: "100%", height: "100%" }}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ChartRenderWidget;
```

This component takes the raw JSON string generated by `fig.to_json()` in Python, parses it, and feeds it directly into `react-plotly.js`.

## Why This Matters

This pattern unlocks powerful capabilities for AI Agents:

1.  **Optimization**: The LLM token context isn't cluttered with massive JSON objects describing chart layouts. It just sees the concise CSV.
2.  **User Experience**: Users get interactive, professional-grade visualizations instantly.
3.  **Separation of Concerns**: Your data logic stays in Python, and your rendering logic stays in React.

## Try It Out

We're building **Orchestra** to make patterns like this easy to deploy.
